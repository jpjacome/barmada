Yes, your solution makes sense and is a good approach for extra security and control:

When a user accesses the QR link for a closed table, you record their IP and mark their request as “pending approval.”
Staff or admin must approve each individual IP (or request) before that user can access the session and place orders.
Once approved, you associate that IP with the session, allowing only that IP to interact with the session for its duration.
If the session closes, the IP loses access and must request approval again for a new session.

Benefits:
- Prevents random users from joining an open session unless approved.
- Allows staff to control exactly who can place orders at a table.
- Adds a layer of traceability and accountability.

Implementation notes:
- You’ll need a table (e.g., table_session_requests) to store: table_session_id, ip_address, status (pending/approved/denied), and timestamps.
- On each request to the order/session page, check if the user’s IP is approved for the current session.
- Only allow order placement if the IP is approved and the session is open.

Let me know if you want help with the migration, model, and controller changes for this!

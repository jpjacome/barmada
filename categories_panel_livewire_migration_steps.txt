Categories Panel Livewire Migration - Step-by-Step Guide
======================================================

Goal: Migrate the categories management panel (add, delete, move up/down) at the top of products/livewire.blade.php from standard Blade forms to a Livewire component for a seamless, no-page-reload UX.

Step 1: Create the Livewire Component
-------------------------------------
1. Run: php artisan make:livewire CategoriesPanel
2. This creates:
   - app/Livewire/CategoriesPanel.php
   - resources/views/livewire/categories-panel.blade.php

Step 2: Move Category Logic to the Component
--------------------------------------------
1. In CategoriesPanel.php:
   - Add properties: $categories, $newCategoryName
   - Add methods:
     - mount(): Load categories for the current editor (filter by editor_id if needed)
     - addCategory(): Validate and create a new category
     - deleteCategory($id): Delete a category by ID
     - moveUp($id): Move a category up in sort order
     - moveDown($id): Move a category down in sort order
   - After each action, reload categories and optionally show a status message.

Step 3: Build the Livewire Blade View
-------------------------------------
1. In categories-panel.blade.php:
   - Add a form for adding a category (wire:model for input, wire:submit.prevent for form)
   - List categories with move up/down and delete buttons (wire:click for each action)
   - Show status messages if desired
   - Use @foreach ($categories as $category) to render the list

Step 4: Replace the Old Panel in products/livewire.blade.php
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Remove the old Blade form and category list (all <form> and <ul> for categories)
2. Insert @livewire('categories-panel') at the top of the page

Step 5: Test the New Panel
--------------------------
1. Add, delete, and move categories in the UI
2. Confirm all actions are instant (no page reload)
3. Check for validation errors and correct status messages

Step 6: (Optional) Polish and Secure
------------------------------------
1. Add authorization checks (only allow the current editor/admin to manage their categories)
2. Add loading indicators or disable buttons during actions
3. Style the panel to match the rest of the UI

Step 7: Remove Old Controller Routes (Optional)
-----------------------------------------------
1. If all category management is now Livewire, remove unused routes from routes/web.php
2. Remove unused methods from CategoryController if not needed elsewhere

Notes:
------
- All category actions are now AJAX/Livewire-powered, so the page never reloads.
- You can further extend the component to support inline editing, drag-and-drop sorting, etc.
- If you encounter Livewire errors, check for missing wire:model, wire:click, or property/method mismatches.

# Implementation Log

This section will document the results of each step in the implementation process, including any issues encountered and how they were resolved. Each step will be meticulously logged to ensure a clear record of progress and troubleshooting.

## Step-by-Step Log

- **Date**: April 28, 2025
- **Progress**: The QR-based table opening system with admin approval is now implemented and functional. The flow is as follows:
  - Customer scans the QR code, which sets the table's status to `pending_approval` and shows a waiting page.
  - Tables with status `pending_approval` appear in a compact "Pending Table Requests" section at the top of the all-orders-list for admins.
  - Admin clicks "Accept" to open the table, generate the unique token, and approve the request.
  - The customer waiting page polls the backend and automatically redirects to the order page when approved.
  - No empty order is created; the flow is now fully table-status based.
  - All UI and backend logic for this workflow is complete and tested.

# Progress Update (April 28, 2025)

- The admin view now displays tables with status `pending_approval` in the "Pending Table Requests" section at the top.
- Admins can approve a request by clicking the Accept button, which sets the table status to `open` and triggers the customer-side redirect.
- No empty order is created; the flow is now fully table-status based.

# Implementation Plan for Secure QR Table Opening with Admin Approval (Revised)

## Step 1: Database Changes

- [x] Add a `unique_token` column to the `tables` table.
- [x] Add a `status` column to the `tables` table.

## Step 2: Backend Logic

- [x] Table status and unique token are managed automatically.
- [x] Table can be set to 'open' or 'closed' and token is generated/cleared accordingly.

## Step 3: QR Code and Table Request Flow (Revised)

- [x] When a customer scans the QR code, the table's status is set to `pending_approval` (no order is created).
- [x] The customer sees a "Table Request Pending" page.
- [x] In the admin view, tables with status `pending_approval` are shown in the "Pending Table Requests" section.
- [x] When the admin approves, the table status is set to `open`, a unique token is generated, and the customer is redirected to `/order/{unique_token}` to place their order.
- [x] No empty order is created until the customer actually places one.

## Step 4: Frontend Changes

- [x] Add a compact "Pending Table Requests" section to the all-orders-list view for admin.
- [x] Add a "Table Request Pending" page for customers after scanning the QR, with automatic polling and redirection.
- [x] Add an "Accept Order Request" button for admins to approve and open the table.

## Step 5: Testing

- [x] Test the full flow: QR scan → table status set to `pending_approval` → admin approval → customer redirected to order page.
- [x] Ensure security: no table can be opened without admin action.

This approach ensures only staff can open tables, but customers can initiate the process themselves. It’s secure, user-friendly, and fits your requirements.

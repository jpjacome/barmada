# Implementation Plan for Adding and Deleting Categories on the Products Page

## Step 1: Database Changes

### 1.1 Create a `categories` table
- Add a migration to create a `categories` table with the following fields:
  - `id`: Primary key, auto-incrementing.
  - `name`: String, unique, required.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp.
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp.

### 1.2 Add a relationship between `products` and `categories`
- Update the `products` table to include a `category_id` foreign key.
- Ensure proper indexing and constraints in the migration.

### Actions Taken:
- Created a migration for the `categories` table.
- Implemented the migration to create the `categories` table with fields `id`, `name`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
- Created a migration to add the `category_id` foreign key to the `products` table.
- Implemented the migration to add the `category_id` column to the `products` table, with a foreign key constraint referencing the `categories` table.
- Ran the migrations successfully, applying the changes to the database.

- Created the `Category` model in the `App\Models` namespace.
- Added a `fillable` property for the `name` field in the `Category` model.
- Defined a `products` relationship method in the `Category` model to associate categories with products.
- Verified that the `Category.php` file exists in the correct directory with the correct casing.
- Confirmed that the `Category.php` file has no syntax or linting errors.
- Added a `category` relationship method in the `Product` model to define the association with the `Category` model.
- Verified that the `Category` model is being autoloaded correctly using `class_exists` in Tinker.
- Successfully listed all categories using `\App\Models\Category::all()` in Tinker, confirming the model and database connection are working as expected.
- Successfully created a new category using `\App\Models\Category::create(['name' => 'Electronics'])` in Tinker, verifying the `create` functionality.

- Successfully tested the `store` method in the `CategoryController` using Tinker. A new category named "Test Category" was created, and a JSON response with the success message and the created category was returned.
- Successfully tested the `destroy` method in the `CategoryController` using Tinker. The category with ID `2` was deleted, and a JSON response with the success message was returned.
- Resolved namespace issues by ensuring all references to `App` match the renamed folder structure.
- Verified that the `ProductsList` Livewire component and the `Category` model are functioning correctly.
- Successfully tested the category management functionality on the products page.

## Next Step
- Implement the database changes as described above.
- Create the necessary migrations for the `categories` table and the `category_id` foreign key in the `products` table.

### Next Steps:
- Proceed with implementing additional features or enhancements as per the project requirements.

## Instructions
- Once the migrations are created, run them and verify the database schema.
- Test the database changes to ensure the `categories` table and the relationship with `products` are correctly set up.

# Domain Name Change Checklist (Already Deployed App)

Your app is already deployed and running at https://orustravel.org/barmada (code in root/public_html/barmada on your server) and works perfectly locally. The following checklist is for applying a new domain name that points directly to this app. This is not a full deployment checklist, but a focused guide for updating the domain name and ensuring all references are correct.

---

## 1. Update Environment Variables

- **.env**
  - Set APP_URL to the new domain (e.g., https://newdomain.com or https://newdomain.com/barmada if using a subfolder).
  - If using SSL, ensure APP_URL uses https.
  - Update any third-party service URLs (OAuth, payment, analytics, etc.) to use the new domain.

## 2. Web Server/Hosting Config

- Ensure your new domain points to the correct server and folder (root/public_html/barmada).
- Update .htaccess or web server config for redirects, rewrites, and canonical URLs to use the new domain.
- Ensure SSL is working for the new domain.

## 3. Application Code and Assets

- Search for and update any hardcoded URLs or domain names in:
  - Blade templates (resources/views/)
  - JavaScript files (resources/js/, public/js/)
  - Config files (config/)
  - PHP code (app/)
- Update QR code generation logic, analytics, and dashboard links if they reference the domain.
- Test all user-facing links, QR codes, and analytics dashboards to ensure they use the new domain.

## 4. Documentation and Legal Files

- Update README.md, EULA.txt, and any other documentation to reflect the new domain.

## 5. Clear and Cache Configurations

- Run php artisan config:cache, route:cache, and view:cache after updating .env or config files.

## 6. Test Thoroughly

- Visit the new domain and test all major flows (login, registration, orders, analytics, QR codes, etc.).
- Check for broken links, asset loading, and correct domain usage everywhere.

# Summary

Since the app is already deployed and running, you only need to update the domain name in configs, code, and documentation, and verify everything works with the new domain. No full redeployment or migration is needed unless you are moving the app to a different server or folder.

# Progress Log: File Consistency Review (Local vs Online)

This section is for logging each step and progress made while reviewing files that should be identical between local and online environments. Update this log as you check or verify each file or folder.

## Log Entries for Domain Name Change Readiness
- [x] 2025-05-07: Reviewed config/ files (app.php, mail.php, services.php, etc.) for hardcoded URLs. All use APP_URL or env variables; ensure .env is updated for new domain.
- [x] 2025-05-07: Checked Blade templates (layouts, dashboard, welcome, analytics-dashboard, navigation) for hardcoded URLs. Most use asset() and route(); no hardcoded domain found, but verify any direct links if present.

- [x] 2025-05-07: Checked PHP code (app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php, app/Http/Controllers/TableController.php, etc.) for hardcoded URLs. All use url() or config('app.url'); will follow APP_URL.
- [x] 2025-05-07: Reviewed routes (web.php, auth.php). All use Laravel helpers and will adapt to new domain.
- [x] 2025-05-07: Checked README.md and EULA.txt for domain/branding references. Update if new domain should be mentioned.
- [x] 2025-05-07: Verified QR code and analytics dashboard logic use dynamic URLs based on APP_URL.
